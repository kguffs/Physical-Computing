This is my project for Physical Computing & Prototyping and the Canes Film Festival. I'll be posting documentation as I work through it in the next week or two. I'm building a pitch detector that categorizes pitches by range and indicates the ranges by color of LED. The hope is to incorporate an on/off function that reacts to how in tune the playing is. I originally worked on this project to react to the trombone, going forward I'd like to test my pitch while singing!
