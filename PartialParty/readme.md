This is my project for Physical Computing & Prototyping and the Canes Film Festival. I'll be posting documentation as I work through it in the next week or two. I'm building an amplitude detector that categorizes amplitude ranges into color of LED as well as outputting encouraging corresponsing messages through LCD. This is meant to be used as a practice tool for singers and instrumentalists in the practice room who can't accurately assess their output given the setting - small, dead rooms make us believe we're playing a lot louder than we are, this assesses that loudness and encourages the players to output a bigger sound in warm up (ideal would be long tones and simple exercises). The goal is to also categorize by pitch as lower register tends to have a harder time being picked up than higher register. For now the goal is to have this little device correspond to my sounds with accurate and encouraging statements.
