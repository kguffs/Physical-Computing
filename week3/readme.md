I created a polling system. Let's say we're rating a song a similar way you might on Pandora. They use thumbs up and thumbs down. Just in time for Valentine's Day, here I've used a pink heart for love and a black upside down heart (spade?) for hate. What's it for? Rate your date! If you have fun with your Valentivities, pink heart! If your night is a bust, black spade. Note: If we used this rating system for songs like Pandora does, the song in the background "21 of May" by Nickel Creek is really good and kind of hilarious, so pink hearts from me all the way.
