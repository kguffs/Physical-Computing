This is the resource I've been using:

https://coertvonk.com/technology/embedded/arduino-pitch-detector-13252

I essentially have to hook up my ACG the same way and follow the same formula to detect pitch, but then correlate those pitches to output.

My question right now is how best to write this code and how best to hook up this amplifier. 

I'd like the end result to look like a responsive stoplight that moves with the changing notes.
